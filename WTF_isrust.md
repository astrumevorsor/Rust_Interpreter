So you're here mr degen. ChatGPT says, we use rust when high performance, reliability, and safety, especially in environments where low-level memory control and concurrency
are key. 

TLDR; we're in a safe space, away from FAANG and crud shills. woohoo (based af)

Key concepts in rust- concurrency, high performance, memory safety- security and reliability, universality/cross platform compatibility, libraries. 
If you learned a programming language earlier and development, skip the below. If ur a virgin lmao https://app.daily.dev/tags/rust?ref=roadmapsh is all you need. 


Look below for arya's notes 

Rust is like a condom for device driver development and hardware low level dev. Shit won't fuck up your hardware system. Makes it excellent for OS. Usually C would mess around with hardware.
We have safety features here, such as ownership and borrowing. We will fuck around and find out later why these are key. 

If you are a CRUD or FAANG shill and are tired of getting destroyed by low performance code, you can use it with JS in DOM/browser. b a s e d. 

Rust being a C replacement, has zero cost abstraction and low level control over system resources. IOT, firmware and low resource pleb gpu poor type beat environments where 
we need memory safety. HOOAH

Rust ensures that race conditions are eliminated at compile time. i.e. async interactions and tasks + multithreading is possible... so yeah you can launch a web server
or do microservices (X api), distributed systems, etc. you name it bro we can cook anything 

Ofc, considering that it has low overhead and performance, it is used to develop game engines or game related tools which need high performance. 

For my lovely gooning degen fucksticks, blockchain systems are built in rust. Concurrency is key in any fucking networking operation. Also lmao imagine if your server crashes
legit you'll be cooked. lmao. 

CLI can be written in rust too.
